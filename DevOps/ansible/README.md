# Ansible
## Getting Started

## Requirements
### Ubuntu Machine
You can use last version of Ubuntu or any other OS 
(Note: unit test done on Ubuntu 14.04 ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-trusty-14.04-amd64-server-20170727 (ami-841f46ff), available through AWS).

### Ansible
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ansible
```

### Set up Hosts and Groups
Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time. It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in Ansibleâ€™s inventory, which defaults to being saved in the location /etc/ansible/hosts. You can specify a different inventory file using the -i <path> option on the command line.

### Dependencies
Run the dependencies playbook to install all dependencies needed for Stow
```
~$ ansible-playbook dependencies.yml -u ubuntu
```
### Add Project
Set up a cronjob to periodically pull the latest changes from your git repo.

### Set up Nginx
```
~$ ansible-playbook nginx.yml -u ubuntu
```

### Configure wellness.conf
Configure the environmental variables located at /roles/stow/files/wellness.conf and then run the following command:

```
~$ ansible-playbook stow.yml -u ubuntu
```
